Ch 0
Intro

Ch 1
Motivation
    - Liquid crystals
    - uses for understanding topologies
    
Ch 2
Literature Survey (?)
    - Liquid crystals
    - Previous statistical methods(?)
    - Topological structures of LCs
        - Q-tensor
        - Yao generation, Onsager theory etc.
        - Experimental findings thus far
        - Consider talking about more defect theory in Yao, maybe too tangential

Ch 3
Monte Carlo methods

Ch 4
Neural Nets & ML, relevance and use in Cond Matt
    - FNN capabilities
    - Ising, XY, etc.

Ch 5
Results
    - More detail on success of FNN on Ising and XY
    - Explaining NNs and embedded structure effect
    - Explain FNN ability on LC
    - Explain RNN ability on LC


* Don't forget, your system is lyotropic because it changes with density and not temperaturew
